- 👋 Hi, I’m @kenanay
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, data science, software development, and creating interactive experiences. I'm also exploring 3D modeling, animation, and game development using tools like Blender, with a focus on applying these skills to educational technology and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python’s deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Learning is a never-ending journey!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to AI and machine learning.
